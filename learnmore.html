            <img src="bloods.png" class="img img-fluid" data-aos="zoom-in" alt="png" style="width: 100%;"/>
            <p>The hospital where my father was confined for almost two weeks does not have its own blood center. When the doctor required my father to have blood transfusion, the hospital nurse told me to look for 3 bags of fresh blood or 3 bags of packed RBC because the hospital laboratory does not have B+ stock. Should you be in the same situation I was in, here are the guidelines on how to avail blood from the Philippine Red Cross, fees and the contact numbers of the blood centers:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ask the doctor or the nurse assigned for a BLOOD REQUEST FORM from the hospital where the patient is admitted. The details needed are: full name of the patient, age, sex and status, blood type and RH group, blood component, number of units needed, diagnosis/indication for transfusion, printed name with signature of the attending physician.</li>
                <li>Call the Philippine Red Cross National Blood Center to inquire and reserve the blood needed. You will be given a reservation code. (See Blood Centers and Phone numbers below)</li>
                <li>Bring the blood request form to the Philippine Red Cross National Blood Center where you made the reservation.</li>
                <li>Bring a cooler or styrofoam container with ice.</li>
                <li>Bring the amount needed to pay for the BLOOD SERVICE FEE. The service fee charged is the significant costs associated with recruitment, collection, testing, processing, storage and handling of blood. The blood service fees charged are in conformance with the stipulated allowable fees mandated by the Department of Health.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">There’s no end to the benefits of donating blood for those who need it. According to the American Red Cross, one donation can save as many as three lives, and someone in the United States needs blood every two seconds.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">It turns out that donating blood doesn’t just benefit recipients. There are health benefits for donors, too, on top of the benefits that come from helping others. Read on to learn the health benefits of donating blood and the reasons behind them.</p>
            <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
            <p>Donating blood has benefits for your emotional and physical health. According to a report by the Mental Health Foundation, helping others can:</p>
            <ul id="red">
                <li>reduce stress</li>
                <li>improve your emotional well-being</li>
                <li>benefit your physical health</li>
                <li>help get rid of negative feelings</li>
                <li>provide a sense of belonging and reduce isolation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Research has found further evidence of the health benefits that come specifically from donating blood.</p>
            <h2>Free health checkup</h2>
            <p>In order to give blood, you’re required to undergo a health screening. A trained staff member performs this checkup. They’ll check your:</p>
            <ul id="red">
                <li>pulse</li>
                <li>blood pressure</li>
                <li>body temperature</li>
                <li>hemoglobin levels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This free mini-physical can offer excellent insight into your health. It can effectively detect problems that could indicate an underlying medical condition or risk factors for certain diseases.</p>
            <p>Your blood is also tested for several diseases. These include:</p>
            <ul id="red">
                <li>hepatitis B</li>
                <li>hepatitis C</li>
                <li>HIV</li>
                <li>West Nile virus</li>
                <li>syphilis</li>
                <li>Trypanosoma cruzi</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Does donating blood lower your risk of heart disease?</h1>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">The research is mixed on whether blood donation actually lowers risk of heart disease and heart attack.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">A 2017 studyTrusted Source suggests that regular blood donations are associated with increased risk of heart disease possibly due to unfavorable cholesterol levels</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">However, donating blood regularly may lower iron stores, according to a 2013 studyTrusted Source. This may reduce the risk of heart attack. High body iron stores are believed to increase the risk of heart attack.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">Regular blood donations were thought to lower blood pressureTrusted Source, but a 2017 studyTrusted Source suggests these observations are deceiving and are not a real physiological response.</p>

            <h2 id="side">Side effects of donating blood</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">Blood donation is safe for healthy adults. There’s no risk of contracting disease. New, sterile equipment is used for each donor.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">Some people may feel nauseous, lightheaded, or dizzy after donating blood. If this happens, it should only last a few minutes. You can lie down with your feet up at the until you feel better.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">You may also experience some bleeding at the site of the needle. Applying pressure and raising your arm for a couple of minutes will usually stop this. You may develop a bruise at the site.</p>
            
            <p>Call the blood donation center if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have arm pain, numbness, or tingling.</li>
                <li>You develop a raised bump or continue bleeding at the needle site.</li>
                <li>You still feel lightheaded, dizzy, or nauseous after drinking, eating, and resting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="donation">During the donation</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">You must register to donate blood. This includes providing identification, your medical history, and undergoing a quick physical examination. You’ll also be given some information about blood donation to read.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">Once you’re ready, your blood donation procedure will begin. Whole blood donation is the most common type of donation. This is because it offers the most flexibility. It can be transfused as whole blood or separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma for different recipients.</p>
            
            <p>For a whole blood donation procedure:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You’ll be seated in a reclining chair. You can donate blood either sitting or lying down.</li>
                <li>A small area of your arm will be cleaned. A sterile needle will then be inserted.</li>
                <li>You’ll remain seated or lying down while a pint of your blood is drawn. This takes 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>When a pint of blood has been collected, a staff member will remove the needle and bandage your arm.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Other types of donation include:</p>
            <ul id="red">
                <li>platelet donation (plateletpheresis)</li>
                <li>plasma donation (plasmapheresis)</li>
                <li>double red cell donation</li>
            </ul>

            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">These types of donations are performed using a process called apheresis. An apheresis machine is connected to both of your arms. It collects a small amount of blood and separates the components before returning the unused components back to you. This cycle is repeated several times over approximately two hours.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up-right">Once your donation is complete, you’ll be given a snack and a drink and be able to sit and rest for 10 or 15 minutes before you leave. If you feel faint or nauseous, you’ll be able to lie down until you feel better.</p>

            <h2 id="whatknow">What to know before you donate</h2>
            <p>Here are some important things to know before you donate:</p>
            <ul id="red">
                <li>You need to be 17 or older to donate whole blood. Some states allow you to donate at 16 with parental consent.</li>
                <li>You have to weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health to donate.</li>
                <li>You need to provide information about medical conditions and any medications you’re taking. These may affect your eligibility to donate blood.</li>
                <li>You must wait at least 8 weeks between whole blood donations and 16 weeks between double red cell donations.</li>
                <li>Platelet donations can be made every 7 days, up to 24 times per year.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following are some suggestions to help you prepare for donating blood:</p>
            <ul id="red">
                <li>Drink an extra 16 ounces of water before your appointment.</li>
                <li>Wear a short-sleeved shirt or a shirt with sleeves that are easy to roll up.</li>
